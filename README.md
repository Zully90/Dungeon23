Secondly, my thanks go to ITA (Italian Translation Alliance) and all the guys of OSR Italia; they are a beatifull and inclusive comunity, let's go ahead like this!

One year!

12 Levels, 52 Themes, 365 Rooms

## Key Idea

Each day is one room (or one environment), one thing of note, and one reason to go/be there.

Possible improvements:
- Empty rooms, corridors, general links would be added later
- Draws could be reorganized and digitally converted using one map design tool

## Disclaimer
- I am totally unable to draw, this project is also an attempt to improve myself in this sense. Be lenient!
- The themes will be addressed without any historical claim, fidelity to the work may not be absolute due to the choices that will be made during the year

## Organization
I am not sure I will publish something every day, depending on the time available I could upload "bunches" of contents.

### Workflow
Every room/environment will be drawn by hand using an iPad and a Apple Pencil; there will be also a "Paper" support: [The Dungeon Architect Grid](https://zwgarth.itch.io/dungeon-workbook).  

## Listing of Day, Level and Theme

The main inspiracy is the Inferno of Dante Alighieri.  
Of course, every level has sublevels (e.g. Gironi and Malebolge), they will be taken into account during the challenge and, probably, the table will be updated.

Al themes are taken from the "Divina Commedia" itself, hopefully I will be able to manage and represent them to the fullest.

| Month (Level)  | Name       | Theme       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | The Forest | Being lost |
| 2 | Vestibule of Hell | The inability to decide |
| 3 | The Acheron  | Waiting for the unknown |
| 4 | First Circle (Limbo) | The unsatisfying desire |
| 5 | Second Circle | Lust |
| 6 | Third Circle | Gluttony |
| 7 | Fourth Circle | Greed |
| 8 | Fifth Circle | Wrath |
| 9 | Sixth Circle | Heresy |
| 10 | Seventh Circle | Violence |
| 11 | Eighth Circle | Fraud |
| 12 | Ninth Circle | Treachery |
